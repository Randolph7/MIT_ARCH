Start to learn about MIT6.004

## Module1

1. Binary and its operation, which I will skip.

2. RISC-V ISA, basic types are Computational, Load&Store and control flow. 

3. Assembly in RISC-V

4. Expressing HLP in RV-ASM

5. Procedure calling convention



Really like the way that lecture describe what ISA is :"The contract between hardware and software."
